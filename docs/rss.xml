        <p>Scientific psychology began as a science of the human mind: a subjective science to complement the objective sciences of physics and biology. It failed. It became satisfied with results instead of answers; measuring behaviors instead of thoughts.</p>
<p>One professional lifespan was enough to forget. Cognitive psychology again tried to model mind. It too failed. Technological progress yielded a neurobehaviorism: cognitive neuroscience; neural correlates substituted for mental causes.</p>
<p>What if the problem isn’t that the question is about minds and what a conscious person feels, but the language we use to express our ideas about answers?</p>

        <p>Why is it what it is that makes it feels like me? And: What is the what
that explains the why?</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>“I am designing a new language. I've reached the limits of
conventional languages, and now they frustrate my attempts to progress
further. They lack the power to express concepts that I need, and even
in their own domain, they're imprecise and unwieldy. They're hardly
fit for speech, let alone for thought.</p>
<p>“Existing linguistic theory is useless; I'll reevaluate basic logic to
determine the suitable atomic components for my language. This
language will support a dialect coexpressive with all of mathematics,
so that any equation I write will have a linguistic equivalent.” - Ted Chiang <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
