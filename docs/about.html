            <h1>Britt Anderson</h1>
            <p>Scientific psychology began as a science of the human mind: a subjective science to complement the objective sciences of physics and biology. It failed. It became satisfied with results instead of answers; measuring behaviors instead of thoughts.</p>
<p>One professional lifespan was enough to forget. Cognitive psychology again tried to model mind. It too failed. Technological progress yielded a <em>neurobehaviorism</em>: cognitive neuroscience; neural correlates substituted for mental causes.</p>
<p>What if the problem isn’t that the question is about minds and what a conscious person feels, but the language we use to express our ideas about answers?</p>
