# A new language

> I am designing a new language. I\'ve reached the limits of
> conventional languages, and now they frustrate my attempts to progress
> further. They lack the power to express concepts that I need, and even
> in their own domain, they\'re imprecise and unwieldy. They\'re hardly
> fit for speech, let alone for thought.
>
> Existing linguistic theory is useless; I\'ll reevaluate basic logic to
> determine the suitable atomic components for my language. This
> language will support a dialect coexpressive with all of mathematics,
> so that any equation I write will have a linguistic equivalent.[^1]
