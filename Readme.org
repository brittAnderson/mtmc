This Repo is for a blog exploring issues of how we can identify and deploy a general language to undergird theoretical psychology. The path explored here is that informal thinking about /mind/ should lead to theories in some formal sense that can be translated to a general purpose mathematical language and the latter will afford a path to transformation into computer code for simulation and exploration.
